# nexus


A Dockerfile for Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager 3, based on Alpine.

To run, binding the exposed port 8081 to the host.

```
$ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 5000:5000 --name nexus clearent/nexus
```


## Notes

*   Default credentials are: `admin` / `admin123`

*   Port 5000 is used in case of docker hosted registry because it need a additional port

*   It can take some time (2-3 minutes) for the service to launch in a
new container.  You can tail the log to determine once Nexus is ready:

```
$ docker logs -f nexus
```

*   Installation of Nexus is to `/opt/sonatype/nexus`.  

*   A persistent directory, `/nexus-data`, is used for configuration,
logs, and storage.

*   Two environment variables can be used to control the JVM arguments

    *   `JAVA_MAX_MEM`, passed as -Xmx.  Defaults to `1200m`.

    *   `JAVA_MIN_MEM`, passed as -Xms.  Defaults to `1200m`.

    These can be used supplied at runtime to control the JVM:

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 5000:5000 --name nexus -e JAVA_MAX_MEM=2048M clearent/nexus
    ```


### SSL

If you want to run Nexus in SSL, you need to create a Java keystore file with your certificate. See the [Jetty documentation](http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html) for help.

You will need to mount your keystore to the appropriate directory and pass in the keystore password as well.

```
$ docker run -d -p 8443:8443 -p 5000:5000 --name nexus -v /path/to/your-keystore.jks:/nexus-data/keystore.jks -e JKS_PASSWORD="changeit" clearent/nexus
```

Nexus will now serve its' UI on HTTPS on port 8443 and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.


### Persistent Data

There are two general approaches to handling persistent storage requirements
with Docker. See [Managing Data in Containers](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/)
for additional information.

1.  *Use a data volume container*.  Since data volumes are persistent
    until no containers use them, a container can created specifically for
    this purpose.  This is the recommended approach.  

    ```
    $ docker run -d --name nexus-data clearent/nexus echo "data-only container for Nexus"
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 5000:5000 --name nexus --volumes-from nexus-data clearent/nexus
    ```

2.  *Mount a host directory as the volume*.

    ```
    $ docker run -d -p 8081:8081 -p 5000:5000 --name nexus -v /some/dir/nexus-data:/nexus-data clearent/nexus
    ```
